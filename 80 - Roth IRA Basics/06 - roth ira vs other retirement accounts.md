# Roth IRA vs. Other Retirement Accounts

Comparing Roth IRAs to other accounts helps determine the best fit for your financial situation:

- **Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA**:
  
  - **Tax Treatment**: Roth contributions are after-tax, with tax-free withdrawals; Traditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible, but withdrawals are taxed as income.

  - **Withdrawal Rules**: Roth allows penalty-free contribution withdrawals; Traditional IRAs penalize most withdrawals before 59½.

  - **RMDs**: Roth has no RMDs during your lifetime; Traditional IRAs require RMDs starting at age 73.

- **Roth IRA vs. 401(k)**:

  - **Contribution Limits**: Roth IRAs have lower limits ($7,000/$8,000 in 2025) compared to 401(k)s ($23,000/$30,500 in 2025).

  - **Employer Involvement**: 401(k)s are employer-sponsored, often with matching contributions; Roth IRAs are individual accounts.

  - **Investment Options**: Roth IRAs typically offer more investment choices than 401(k)s, which may have limited fund options.

- **When to Choose a Roth IRA**: Ideal if you expect higher taxes in retirement, are early in your career, or want withdrawal flexibility. It’s also a good complement to a 401(k) for tax diversification.

Combining accounts strategically can optimize your retirement plan.
