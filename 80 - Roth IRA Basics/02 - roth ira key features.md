# Key Features of a Roth IRA

The Roth IRA offers distinct features that set it apart from other retirement accounts, making it a powerful tool for long-term financial planning. Below are its core characteristics:

- **Tax Advantages**: Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax income, meaning you don’t get a tax deduction when you contribute. However, the account’s earnings grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals in retirement are also tax-free. This is particularly beneficial if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket during retirement or if tax rates increase in the future.

- **Contribution Rules**: You can contribute to a Roth IRA only if you have earned income (e.g., wages, salaries, or self-employment income). Contributions are limited annually (for 2025, the limit is $7,000 for those under 50 and $8,000 for those 50 and older, subject to IRS updates). Unlike Traditional IRAs, contributions are not tax-deductible, but the after-tax nature ensures tax-free withdrawals later.

- **Withdrawal Rules**: Roth IRAs offer flexibility for withdrawals. You can withdraw your contributions (not earnings) at any time without penalty or taxes, as these funds were already taxed. However, withdrawing earnings before age 59½ or before the account has been open for five years may incur taxes and a 10% penalty, unless an exception applies (e.g., first-time home purchase). Qualified withdrawals—after age 59½ and a five-year holding period—are entirely tax- and penalty-free.

- **No Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**: Unlike Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, Roth IRAs do not require you to take distributions during your lifetime. This allows your investments to grow tax-free for as long as you wish, making it an excellent tool for long-term savings or estate planning.

These features make the Roth IRA a versatile option, offering both tax benefits and flexibility for savers planning for retirement or legacy goals.
