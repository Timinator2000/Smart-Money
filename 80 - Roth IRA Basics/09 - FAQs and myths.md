# FAQs and Myths

Common questions and misconceptions about Roth IRAs include:

- **FAQ: Can I contribute to a Roth IRA if I have a 401(k)?** Yes, as long as you meet income eligibility and stay within contribution limits. The two accounts are independent.

- **FAQ: Is a Roth IRA only for young people?** No, anyone with earned income can contribute, regardless of age, as long as they meet MAGI limits.

- **Myth: Roth IRAs are too complicated.** The rules (e.g., five-year rule, income limits) are straightforward once understood, and providers often guide you through setup.

- **Myth: You canâ€™t touch a Roth IRA until retirement.** Contributions can be withdrawn anytime without penalty, offering flexibility not found in other accounts.

Consult the IRS website or a financial advisor for clarity on specific situations.
