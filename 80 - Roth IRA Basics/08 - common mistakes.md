# Common Mistakes to Avoid

Avoid these pitfalls to ensure your Roth IRA remains effective:

- **Exceeding Contribution Limits**: Contributing more than allowed triggers a 6% excise tax on excess contributions annually until corrected. Track contributions across all IRAs to stay within limits.

- **Missing Income Eligibility**: If your MAGI exceeds the phase-out range, contributions are disallowed. Verify your income annually to avoid penalties.

- **Improper Withdrawals**: Withdrawing earnings too early without an exception can lead to taxes and penalties. Understand the rules before accessing funds.

- **Neglecting Beneficiary Designations**: Failing to name or update beneficiaries can complicate asset transfer. Review designations after major life events (e.g., marriage, divorce).

Staying informed and proactive prevents costly errors.
