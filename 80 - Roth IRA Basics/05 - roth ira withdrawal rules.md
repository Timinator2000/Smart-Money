# Roth IRA Withdrawal Rules

Understanding withdrawal rules is critical to avoid penalties and maximize benefits:

- **Qualified Withdrawals**: Tax- and penalty-free if you’re 59½ or older and the account has been open for five years (the “five-year rule”). This applies to earnings; contributions are always withdrawable tax- and penalty-free.

- **Non-Qualified Withdrawals**: Withdrawing earnings before age 59½ or the five-year period may incur income taxes and a 10% penalty, unless an exception applies.

- **Exceptions for Penalty-Free Withdrawals**:
  - Up to $10,000 for a first-time home purchase.
  - Qualified higher education expenses (e.g., tuition for you or dependents).
  - Certain medical expenses or health insurance premiums during unemployment.
  - Disability or death of the account holder.

- **Five-Year Rule**: Starts on January 1 of the year you make your first contribution. Each Roth IRA has its own five-year clock for conversions or rollovers.

- **Tax and Penalty Implications**: Non-qualified withdrawals of earnings are taxed as ordinary income, with a 10% penalty if no exception applies. Contributions are always accessible without penalty.

Plan withdrawals carefully to preserve tax advantages and avoid unnecessary costs.
