# Eligibility and Contribution Limits

To contribute to a Roth IRA, you must meet specific eligibility criteria based on income and other factors:

- **Income Eligibility**: Your ability to contribute depends on your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). For 2025, single filers with MAGI below $144,000 can contribute the full amount, with phase-out ranges between $144,000 and $161,000. For married couples filing jointly, the full contribution is allowed if MAGI is below $230,000, with phase-outs between $230,000 and $240,000 (subject to IRS updates).

- **Annual Contribution Limits**: In 2025, the contribution limit is $7,000 for individuals under 50 and $8,000 for those 50 and older (including a $1,000 catch-up contribution). These limits apply across all your IRAs (Roth and Traditional combined).

- **Age Considerations**: There’s no age limit for contributions, as long as you have earned income. This makes Roth IRAs accessible to both young workers and older individuals still earning income.

- **Spousal Roth IRAs**: A non-working spouse can contribute to a Roth IRA based on the working spouse’s income, provided the couple files taxes jointly and meets the MAGI limits. This allows both spouses to build retirement savings.

Always check the IRS website for the latest income and contribution limits, as they adjust annually for inflation.
