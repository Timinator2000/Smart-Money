# Introduction to Roth IRAs

A Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is a tax-advantaged retirement savings account designed to help individuals save for retirement with unique tax benefits. Unlike other retirement accounts, contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars, meaning you pay taxes on the money before contributing. In return, qualified withdrawals in retirement—including earnings—are tax-free, making it an attractive option for long-term wealth building.

The Roth IRA was established under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, named after Senator William Roth, who championed its creation. It was introduced to provide Americans with a flexible, tax-efficient way to save for retirement, complementing other accounts like Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s. Since its inception, the Roth IRA has become a cornerstone of retirement planning due to its tax-free growth and withdrawal flexibility.

Retirement planning is critical in today’s economy, where rising life expectancy and inflation underscore the need for robust savings. A Roth IRA plays a vital role in this strategy by offering tax-free growth, no mandatory withdrawals during the account holder’s lifetime, and the ability to pass wealth to heirs tax-free. Whether you’re just starting your career or nearing retirement, understanding the Roth IRA’s benefits can help you build a secure financial future.
