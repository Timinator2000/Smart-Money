# Is There Something Here for You?

This tutorial covers a lot of ground. The questions below can help you quickly identify what sections are most relevant to your situation.

* **Do you have a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k)?**

If so, be sure to review the section on proper risk allocation. Making smart choices here can significantly improve your long-term outcomes.

* **Do you have kids or grandkids earning money from jobs like dog-walking, babysitting, or working at a local restaurant?**

If yes, don’t miss the section on jumpstarting their financial future through early Roth IRA contributions. A little now can mean a lot later.

* **Do you have excess savings—beyond your emergency fund?**

Whether it’s due to diligent saving or a recent inheritance, if this money isn’t already earmarked for a specific goal (like a new car or home remodel), you may have untapped opportunities. Learn how to align your overall financial strategy with your goals to make a meaningful long-term impact—for yourself and those you care about.

* **Are you already maxing out your own retirement contributions?**

* **Could you help adult children with their retirement savings?**

* **Do you have a plan to minimize the taxes on your own retirement income?**

If any of this resonates with you, let’s explore further.

In the big picture, life is short—but the years add up. The decisions you make today can have powerful consequences over the next 30 years and beyond. Even if you don’t expect to live another 30 years, someone you love probably will. You may have the rare opportunity to wrap your family tree in strategies so strong, they provide support across multiple generations.
