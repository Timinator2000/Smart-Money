\*Rounded total‑return CAGRs, 1 Jan 2005 – 31 Dec 2024 (or closest 20‑year window each source covers).

**Take‑away:** High‑growth equity, especially technology‑heavy QQQ, compounded roughly 4‑5× faster than core bonds. Capturing that differential tax‑free is why Roth space—and, next, Traditional space with conversion potential—should host the most potent assets.

| **Location‑aware layout**             | 1 **Roth IRA** – filled with QQQ, small‑cap & EM funds (full 70 % equity until cap is reached).<br>2 **401(k)** – *next* tranche of equity plus all fixed income needed to hit 30 % overall.<br>3 **Brokerage** – unused unless both tax‑favored wrappers are full; then low‑turnover index ETFs. | 1 **Roth Solo 401(k)** – QQQ + EM + small‑cap growth.<br>2 **SEP‑IRA (pre‑tax)** – remaining equity allocation plus core bonds (all convertible later).<br>3 **Brokerage** – only tax‑efficient broad ETFs once Roth/SEP space is maxed. |
| **Why it aligns with your principle** | After Roth is stuffed, *additional* high‑octane growth goes into the 401(k) because every pre‑tax dollar **could** be converted to Roth in a future low‑income window.                                                                                                                            | Same logic: Carlos keeps his next‑highest potential return inside the pre‑tax SEP, preserving optional conversion flexibility.                                                                                                           |

Both investors still hold a 70 / 30 risk mix **in aggregate**, but more of their high‑return engine is sheltered (or shelter‑able) from future taxes.

#### 4 | Guiding Principles (No Recommendations Intended)

1. **Allocate across wrappers, not inside each one.**
2. **Fill Roth first with the biggest return potential.** Once full, send the *next* tier of growth to Traditional accounts—conversion optionality is valuable.
3. **Let lower‑return assets absorb the ordinary‑income hit.** Core bonds in Traditional space defer taxes you’d owe anyway at RMD time.
4. **Taxable is last resort for equities.** Use it only when all tax‑advantaged space is maxed, and prefer ultra‑tax‑efficient ETFs/munis.
5. **Mind the mechanics.** Fund menus, rebalancing frequency, and future tax brackets matter—coordinate with qualified financial and tax advisors.

### Conclusion

A moderately aggressive portfolio isn’t just 70 % stocks and 30 % bonds—it’s that mix **strategically parked** so the fastest‑growing pieces either grow tax‑free now (Roth) or retain the right to become tax‑free later (Traditional ➜ Roth conversion). Over decades, that subtle positioning can translate into thousands—or even hundreds of thousands—of extra after‑tax dollars for you and, ultimately, your heirs.

Because Roth dollars will never be taxed again, every extra percentage point of return compounds untouched—making location every bit as powerful as traditional stock‑bond diversification.
