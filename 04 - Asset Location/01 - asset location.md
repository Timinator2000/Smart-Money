# Asset Location Deserves Significant Attention

Most investors stop at **risk profile**—how much stock‑market risk (70 % equities / 30 % fixed income is used here) they can stomach. Yet *where* each slice sits—**asset location**—often delivers a quieter but surprisingly large payoff:

| Account Wrapper | Taxes While Growing | Taxes When Withdrawn | Conceptual “Best Home” for… |
| --------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Qualified (Roth)** | 0 % | 0 % | **Highest‑octane growth assets** |
| **Qualified (Traditional)** | Tax‑deferred | Ordinary income | Next‑highest growth assets |
| **Non-Qualified** | Ongoing taxes on earnings/realized gains | n/a  | Only after tax‑advantaged space is stuffed |

Because Roth dollars will *never* be taxed again, every extra percentage point of return compounds untouched—making location every bit as powerful as traditional stock‑bond diversification. 

# 🔑 Core Principle

>Whatever it is you want to invest in, where you hope to get the biggest returns, must be placed in one of your Roth accounts if at all possible!

Roth accounts are unique:

* No taxes while the money grows.

* No taxes when you take the money out.

* No required minimum distributions (RMDs) during your lifetime.

* Your heirs can have another 10 years of tax-free growth after you pass via an inherited Roth IRA.

Let's take a look at the types of returns achieved over the past 10 to 20 years in various asset classes to really solidify why this concept is so important.
