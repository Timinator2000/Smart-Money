# Madison

Let’s bring this strategy to life with a real-world example. Meet Madison, a responsible and entrepreneurial young girl. At just 10 years old, she begins walking her neighbor’s dog for $10 per half-hour walk.

Over the next few years, Madison continues building her mini side business. By the time she's 15, she adds babysitting to her list of services, increasing her income significantly. At 17, she trades dog walking and babysitting for a part-time job at a local fast food restaurant, where she earns a steady paycheck all through high school and college.

Now imagine Madison’s parent—let’s say her mom, Mary—takes the initiative to file a simple tax return each year and contributes the maximum allowed to a custodial Roth IRA on Madison’s behalf, up to the amount of Madison’s earned income. These contributions are modest at first, increasing as Madison earns more, and they stop altogether when she graduates college at 22. From that point forward, Madison completely forgets about the Roth IRA and never contributes another dime.

What happens to her Roth account under these conditions? Let’s take a look.


### Projection Highlights

| Scenario (annualized)                                               | Balance at graduation (age 22, end 2025) | Total contributions (ages 10‑22) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **7 % “plain‑vanilla” growth**                                      | **≈ \$64,800**                           | \$49,500                         |
| **18.2 % tech‑heavy growth**<br>(10‑yr average total return of QQQ) | **≈ \$105,000**                          | \$49,500                         |




*The full year‑by‑year schedule

You spotted a mistake—thank you for catching it.

**What happened?**
In the year‑by‑year table I hurriedly shared, I accidentally compounded the 18.2 % return on **two different balances** in the same loop, which overstated the growth after 2022. The earlier summary figure—≈ \$105 k—was the one based on the correct single‑compounding method. Below is the **corrected schedule** for both growth assumptions.

### Correct year‑by‑year Roth IRA projection

*End‑of‑year balances assume contributions are made at **year‑end** (so they start compounding the following January).*

| Year | Age | Contribution | Balance @ 7 %   | Balance @ 18.2 % |
| ---- | --- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 2013 | 10  | \$1,000      | \$1,000.00      | \$1,000.00       |
| 2014 | 11  | \$1,000      | \$2,070.00      | \$2,182.00       |
| 2015 | 12  | \$1,000      | \$3,214.90      | \$3,579.12       |
| 2016 | 13  | \$1,000      | \$4,439.94      | \$5,230.52       |
| 2017 | 14  | \$1,000      | \$5,750.74      | \$7,182.48       |
| 2018 | 15  | \$3,000      | \$9,153.29      | \$11,489.69      |
| 2019 | 16  | \$3,000      | \$12,793.02     | \$16,580.82      |
| 2020 | 17  | \$6,000      | \$20,658.53     | \$25,598.52      |
| 2021 | 18  | \$6,000      | \$27,067.87     | \$36,257.45      |
| 2022 | 19  | \$6,000      | \$34,962.63     | \$48,856.31      |
| 2023 | 20  | \$6,500      | \$43,910.01     | \$64,248.16      |
| 2024 | 21  | \$7,000      | \$53,983.71     | \$82,941.33      |
| 2025 | 22  | \$7,000      | **\$64,762.57** | **\$105,036.65** |

### Key takeaways

* **Total contributions:** \$49,500
* **Graduation‑day balances:**

  * **7 % scenario:** ≈ \$64.8 k (unchanged)
  * **18.2 % scenario:** ≈ \$105 k (corrected)

I apologize for the confusion in that interim table. Feel free to drop this corrected schedule straight into your tutorial, and let me know if you’d like any additional charts or formatting tweaks!

#### Key assumptions

1. **Contribution pattern**

   * Ages 10‑14: \$1,000/year
   * Ages 15‑16: \$3,000/year (dog‑walking + babysitting)
   * Ages 17‑18‑19: contribution capped at the **Roth limit** (\$6,000 for 2020‑2022)
   * Age 20 (2023): \$6,500 (new limit)
   * Ages 21‑22 (2024‑2025): \$7,000 each year

   Over 13 years, Madison (or Mom as custodian) puts in **\$49,500** total.

2. **Timing of deposits** — Each contribution is treated as if it arrives at **year‑end**, so it begins compounding the following January.

3. **Growth rates**

   * **7 %**: a conservative, long‑run equity return proxy.
   * **18.2 %**: the 10‑year annualized total return of the tech‑heavy NASDAQ‑100 ETF *Invesco QQQ* as of spring 2025 ([financecharts.com][1], [investopedia.com][2]).

---

### What the numbers mean

* **Conservative path (7 %)** — By the time Madison turns 22, her Roth already tops **\$64 k**. Starting adult life with a mid‑five‑figure, never‑taxed nest egg is a huge psychological and financial boost.

* **Aggressive tech tilt (18 %)** — If Mom had steered contributions into something like *QQQ* and the market delivered similar growth, Madison would graduate with **\$105 k**—more than double the conservative case.

Either way, the strategy shows why **filing that small Schedule C, paying one‑time self‑employment (SE) tax, and locking in Roth eligibility early can be a generational game‑changer**:

* The **SE tax outlay** on \$49,500 of cumulative self‑employment income is roughly \$7,600—spread over 13 returns. That cost is quickly dwarfed by decades of tax‑free compounding.
* Madison also earns Social Security credits for those SE tax payments, adding a modest retirement benefit down the road.

The earlier the runway, the more dramatic the effect—so making that first custodial Roth contribution the moment a child has legitimate earned income is one of the simplest “outside‑the‑box” moves a parent can make.

If Madison forgets about her Roth IRA after graduating at age 22 and makes **no additional contributions**, here’s what her account would grow to by age **60** (38 years later):

* **At 7% annual growth:** ≈ **\$847,047**
* **At 18.2% annual growth:** ≈ **\$60,367,747**

These values are **completely tax-free** under Roth IRA rules, assuming qualified withdrawals. The takeaway? Even modest contributions in childhood can become generational wealth—**especially when paired with time and compounding.**
