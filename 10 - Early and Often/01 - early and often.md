## Why “Roth Early and Often” Can Be a Game‑Changer for Kids

# Compounding Has a Head Start

When a contribution is made at age 10, the money can compound for 50‑70 years before the child ever taps it. Even a modest amount invested that long can snowball into a life‑changing sum—especially inside a Roth IRA, where qualified withdrawals are completely tax‑free.

# How the Contribution Works

* **Earned income is the key.** A child may contribute (or have someone contribute for them) up to the lesser of their earned income for the year or the annual Roth IRA limit.

* **Custodial Roth IRA.** Until the child reaches the age of majority, a parent or guardian opens and manages the account as “custodian,” but the money remains the child’s.

# Filing a Tax Return to Document Income

Even if the child’s earnings come from dog‑walking, babysitting, lawn care, or tutoring, those dollars count as self‑employment income. The IRS expects that income to be reported on the child’s tax return (usually on Schedule C plus a self‑employment tax form). Most custodians will accept a Roth contribution only if the income is documented, so filing a return formalizes the process and keeps everything audit‑proof.

# Standard Deduction = Zero (or Near‑Zero) Income Tax

For dependent children, the standard deduction generally equals their earned income up to a capped amount (which adjusts for inflation each year). In practice, that means a child who earns a few hundred—or even a few thousand—dollars will owe **no federal income tax**. The return is filed largely to prove the income existed, not to write a check to the IRS.

# The Self‑Employment Tax Hurdle

Self‑employment (SE) income is subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes (15.3 % combined in 2025) once it exceeds a very low threshold. Parents often balk at the idea of sending that money to the United States Treasury. Yet over a lifetime, the value of decades of tax‑free Roth growth can dwarf the small, one‑time SE tax cost:

| One‑time Roth Contribution | Potential Value after 60 Years\* | One‑time SE Tax (15.3 %) | Outcome |
| :-------------------------: |:-------------------------------: | :-----------------------: | :---: |
| \$1,000 | ≈ \$57,000 | \$153 | A price many would gladly pay for \$57k tax‑free at retirement |

\*Assumes 7 % annual growth, compounded.

Parents might also take comfort in knowing those SE tax payments help the child earn future Social Security credits.

# Bottom Line

* **Document the earnings** with a simple tax return.

* **Embrace the small SE tax** as the cost of admission to decades of tax‑free growth.

* **Fund the Roth immediately**—even a small annual amount gives compounding an enormous runway.

Taken together, these steps open the door for a child to start adulthood with a meaningful, tax‑advantaged nest egg—and teach lifelong lessons about saving and investing along the way.
