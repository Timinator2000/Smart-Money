# Avoid Paying Fees with Roth Money

You should be getting the hint by now - Roth Money is King!



**Short answer**

No—when your traditional (pretax) IRA itself pays an “ordinary and necessary” investment-management or custodial fee directly to the adviser or custodian, the IRS does **not** treat that debit as a distribution to you.  Nothing is added to your gross income, no Form 1099-R is issued, and no withholding is required.  The fee simply shrinks the IRA balance, so you’ll have a little less money left to be taxed later.&#x20;

### Why it isn’t taxable

* **Revenue Ruling 84-146** and a long line of private-letter rulings say that trustee, record-keeping, and asset-based “wrap” or advisory fees are expenses of the IRA itself.  When the custodian deducts them from the account, they’re *not* “deemed distributions” and therefore are **not reported on Form 1099-R**.&#x20;
* The rulings stress that the fee must relate only to the IRA and be paid directly to the third-party provider.  If an IRA debit also pays for advice on your taxable accounts or another family member’s assets, it can be a **prohibited transaction** under IRC § 4975, which would disqualify the entire IRA.

### Paying the fee **out of pocket** instead

You’re allowed to tell the custodian to bill you personally and leave the IRA intact.

* Doing so is **not** treated as a new contribution (so you don’t eat up your annual contribution limit).&#x20;
* Before 2018, that out-of-pocket fee was a miscellaneous itemized deduction (subject to the 2 %-of-AGI floor). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act suspended all such deductions for 2018-2025, so today you usually get **no current tax break** for paying with outside dollars. ([irs.gov][1])
* Even without a deduction, many advisers still recommend paying from taxable funds so the *full* IRA balance keeps compounding tax-deferred. Whether that’s worth it depends on your fee level, time horizon, and expected tax bracket.

| Let the IRA pay the advisory fee                            | Not taxable now; lowers future RMDs                                                            | Make sure the fee covers **only** that IRA and is billed directly by the custodian/adviser.             |
| Pay the fee from a taxable account                          | No deduction through 2025; IRA keeps growing                                                   | Treated as a personal expense rather than a contribution; helps maximize long-term tax-deferred growth. |
| Have one “wrap” fee covering IRA **and** brokerage accounts | **Don’t** pay it solely from the IRA—prorate or pay outside to avoid a prohibited transaction. |                                                                                                         |

### Bottom line

Paying a legitimate advisory or custodial fee directly from your traditional IRA **does not create taxable income today**; it merely reduces the untaxed balance still inside the account.  If you’d rather preserve the full IRA for compounding—and you’re willing to lose a deductible expense that’s currently suspended anyway—pay the invoice from a taxable account instead.
