# What About Trust Accounts?

Trusts, such as living trusts or irrevocable trusts, are legal entities that can own assets, including accounts classified as non-qualified, qualified (traditional), or qualified (Roth). For example, a living trust might hold a taxable brokerage account (non-qualified), while an irrevocable trust could own a taxable brokerage account or an inherited IRA (traditional or Roth).

The introduction of trusts does not alter the three classifications above, as the tax treatment of the accounts remains the same regardless of ownership structure. However, trusts can impact tax and estate planning by offering benefits like probate avoidance (living trusts) or creditor protection (irrevocable trusts), which may influence how assets are held within the three categories. Always consult a tax or legal professional to align trust strategies with your financial goals.
