# Good, Better, Best

In U.S. financial and retirement planning, wealth is typically divided into three categories: non-qualified, qualified (traditional), and qualified (Roth) accounts as discussed on the previous pages. Non-qualified accounts include taxable assets like brokerage accounts or real estate, taxed yearly on earnings. Qualified (traditional) accounts, such as IRAs or 401(k)s, offer tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth, with withdrawals taxed later. Qualified (Roth) accounts, like Roth IRAs, use after-tax contributions for tax-free withdrawals after age 59½ and a five-year holding period. Most financial assets fit these categories, though some, like business equity or collectibles, may not. This framework underpins the tax and investment strategies discussed here.

This presentation assumes Roth accounts are generally better than traditional accounts, and traditional accounts are generally better than non-qualified accounts, based on tax benefits. Key reasons include:

- **Roth Accounts**: After-tax contributions grow tax-free, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free, ideal for those expecting higher future tax rates. No required minimum distributions (RMDs) offer flexibility.
 
- **Traditional Accounts**: Tax-deductible contributions and deferred growth reduce current taxes and boost compounding compared to non-qualified accounts, where earnings face annual taxes.

- **Non-Qualified Accounts**: These lack tax advantages, making them less efficient for long-term growth but more accessible for immediate needs.

# All Rules Have Exceptions

This hierarchy may not always apply. Exceptions include:

- **Traditional Over Roth**: Could be preferable if you’re in a high tax bracket now but expect a lower one in retirement, maximizing the value of deductions.
 
- **Non-Qualified Over Traditional**: Useful for liquidity needs, as qualified accounts penalize early withdrawals. Tax strategies like loss harvesting or municipal bonds can also favor non-qualified accounts.

- **Non-Financial Assets**: Real estate or business equity may offer unique benefits, like appreciation, that outweigh qualified account tax advantages.

These exceptions emphasize the need for personalized financial planning based on tax situations, liquidity, and asset types. **Be sure to build a plan with your financial advisor before implementing anything in this tutorial.**
