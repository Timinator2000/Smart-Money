# Non-Qualified Accounts

These encompass assets held outside of tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as taxable brokerage accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, real estate, or personal property (e.g., vehicles, jewelry). Non-qualified assets do not receive special tax treatment, meaning earnings like interest, dividends, or capital gains are typically subject to taxes in the year they are realized. This category is broad and includes most forms of wealth not specifically designated for retirement under IRS rules, offering flexibility in access but no tax deferral or exemption.
