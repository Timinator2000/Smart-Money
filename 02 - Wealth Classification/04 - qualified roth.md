# Qualified (Roth) Accounts

These include retirement accounts like Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s, which also comply with IRS rules but differ in tax treatment. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning no tax deduction is available at the time of contribution. However, qualified withdrawals—typically after age 59½ and a five-year holding period—are entirely tax-free, including both contributions and earnings. This makes Roth accounts advantageous for individuals anticipating higher tax rates in retirement or seeking tax-free income, provided they meet the qualification criteria.
