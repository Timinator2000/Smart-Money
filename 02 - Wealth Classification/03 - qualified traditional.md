# Qualified (Traditional) Accounts

These are retirement accounts that meet IRS regulations for tax-deferred growth, such as traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, or similar plans. Contributions to these accounts are often tax-deductible, reducing taxable income in the year of contribution. The investments grow tax-deferred, meaning no taxes are owed on earnings until funds are withdrawn, typically in retirement. Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income, and early withdrawals before age 59Â½ may incur penalties, making these accounts suited for long-term retirement planning.
